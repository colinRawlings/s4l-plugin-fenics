# Example 1: Poisson Equation on a Unit Square

This example demonstrates how to solve the Poisson equation on a unit square domain using the FEniCS plugin in Sim4Life. The mesh and simulation setup are pre-configured for quick experimentation.

- **Physics**: Poisson equation
- **Domain**: Unit square
- **Boundary conditions**: Dirichlet (u=0 on boundary)

## Files
- `mesh.xml`: The mesh for the unit square domain.
- `simulation_setup.json`: Pre-configured simulation setup for Sim4Life.

## How it works
The Poisson equation is solved with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. You can open this project in Sim4Life, inspect the mesh, and run the simulation directly.
