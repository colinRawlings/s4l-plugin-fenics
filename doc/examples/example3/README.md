# Example 3: Heat Equation (Transient)

This example solves the transient heat equation on a simple mesh. The simulation is pre-configured for time-dependent analysis in Sim4Life.

- **Physics**: Heat equation (transient)
- **Domain**: Square
- **Boundary conditions**: Insulated except one edge with fixed temperature

## Files
- `mesh.xml`: The mesh for the domain.
- `simulation_setup.json`: Time-dependent simulation setup.

## How it works
This example illustrates how to run a transient simulation. You can modify the boundary conditions or material properties in Sim4Life for further exploration.
