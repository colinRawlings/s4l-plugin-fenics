# Example 4: Laplace Equation on a Circle

This example demonstrates solving the Laplace equation on a circular domain. The mesh and setup are ready for use in Sim4Life with the FEniCS plugin.

- **Physics**: Laplace equation
- **Domain**: Circle
- **Boundary conditions**: Dirichlet (u=1 on boundary)

## Files
- `mesh.xml`: The mesh for the circular domain.
- `simulation_setup.json`: Simulation setup for Laplace equation.

## How it works
Open the project in Sim4Life to visualize the mesh and run the Laplace simulation. You can experiment with different boundary conditions or source terms.
