# Example 2: Linear Elasticity in 2D

This example shows a simple linear elasticity simulation on a rectangular domain. The setup is ready to use in Sim4Life with the FEniCS plugin.

- **Physics**: Linear elasticity
- **Domain**: Rectangle
- **Boundary conditions**: Fixed left edge, traction on right edge

## Files
- `mesh.xml`: The mesh for the rectangular domain.
- `simulation_setup.json`: Simulation setup for linear elasticity.

## How it works
The example demonstrates how to set up and solve a 2D elasticity problem. Open the project in Sim4Life to explore the setup and results.
