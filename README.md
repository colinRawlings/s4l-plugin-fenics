# FEniCS Simulation Plugin

## Overview

This plugin for Sim4Life integrates the FEniCS finite element library, enabling advanced simulation capabilities for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). It provides a flexible and powerful framework for modeling a wide range of physical phenomena using finite element methods.

## Mathematical Model

The plugin leverages the FEniCS library to solve PDEs of the form:

$$\mathcal{L}(u) = f$$

Where:

- $u$ is the solution field (e.g., temperature, displacement, etc.)
- $\mathcal{L}$ is a differential operator (e.g., Laplacian, elasticity operator)
- $f$ is the source term or forcing function

## Features

- General-purpose finite element solver
- Support for custom PDE formulations
- Integration with the Sim4Life modeling environment
- Boundary condition types:
  - Dirichlet (fixed value)
  - Neumann (flux or derivative)
- Customizable source terms
- Results visualization and post-processing

## Usage

1. Create a new simulation by selecting "FEniCS" from the simulation types
2. Define the PDE formulation and material properties
3. Set up boundary conditions on model surfaces
4. Configure source terms if needed
5. Adjust mesh settings for your desired resolution
6. Run the simulation
7. Visualize and analyze the results

## Example Applications

- Structural mechanics simulations
- Heat transfer analysis
- Fluid dynamics modeling
- Electromagnetic field simulations
- Multiphysics coupling

## Technical Implementation

This plugin is implemented as a modular component with:

- Model classes for simulation settings
- Controller classes for UI integration
- Solver backend powered by FEniCS
- Input/output handlers for data processing

## Requirements

- Sim4Life core application
- Python 3.11 or higher
- FEniCS library (compatible version)

## Installation

The plugin can be installed directly through pip:

```bash
pip install s4l-fenics-plugin
```

For development installations:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd fenics
pip install -e .
